//variable declaration

val applicationcontext : Context = applicationcontext
//means val read only , a variable applicationcontext of type Context
//Note it is not class , so don't think extends Context



//function declaration
fun accept(k : Int , list : List<Int>) : String{
    println("$k is the number")
    var gg = "hello"
    return gg
}

//for functions we need to explicitly tell the type of variable
//and for return a string you need to declare , default is unit


clean architecture says domain , datalayer and presentation
